    <h2>APPLICATIONS & REFLECTIONS</h2>
    <h4 class="section-text">
        This brings us to our final section! We've had a trivial glance at some of the physics and phenomena we see in the Spider-Man film universe and we've looked into further explaining how to make this fiction into a reality. This brings us to our final question - why? Why do we care at all about any of this?
        The first thing to draw attention back to is the initial name of the project - 'What Can Engineers Learn From Spider-Man?'. Being a personal project, the answer to the question of 'why?' is therefore a personal matter - people have long struggled to give a concrete definition to engineering but to me, in its simplest terms, it's about the utilisation of
        maths, science and design (amongst others) as tools in order to meet the needs of society. The crux of engineering (again, for me personally) is in helping people. So the answer to why I'm interested in this project is because if we can hold on to our childhood heroes, use our imagination and momentarily suspend disbelief, we may find that 
        there is serious potential hidden away in Spider-Man that could effect great positive change in our real world.
        <br />
        <br />
        So what sorts of ways could our findings help? What are the applications of these discoveries?

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <h4 class="section-text">
        We've mentioned a number of desirable characterisitcs about spider silk over the course of this project - they all mainly revolve around a a few key properties. They are: an impressive strength:weight ratio, superior elasticity, an ability to greatly absorb energy (think flies travelling at high velocity getting stopped by webs) and the sustainability and green factor.
        With those in mind, there's a plethora of varied uses for this silk, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Better cables for suspension bridges, towing cars</li>
            <li>Lighter fabrics (for sail cloth, parachutes, hot air balloons)<sup>[1]</sup></li>
            <li>Airbags in cars for better absorption of energy/lower impact to the passenger<sup>[2]</sup></li>
            <li>Body armour like Kevlar<sup>[2]</sup></li>
            <li>More delicate fabrics for high fashion and more eco-friendly fabrics for the wider market<sup>[3]</sup></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
            suspension bridges<br /><br />
            strong adhesives<br /><br />
            moral lessons?<br /><br />
            if we had a material with the properties like that of the film, what could we achieve etc.
            <br /><br />
            then talk a bit about project reflections, what I wish I could do, how I would improve, making of the website etc. 
            <br /><br />
            about website - based off basil by squarespace, maybe wiki reference jumps type thing
            <br /><br />
            web properties that are attractive - recyclable, eco friendly
            Other potential applications include sail cloth, parachute fabric, hot air balloon material, and bike or skateboard helmets. The material is biocompatible, which means it could be used inside the human body for things like stitches
