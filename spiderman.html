                <h2>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h2>
                <h4>This project, entitled ‘What can engineers learn from Spider-Man?’ is my submission for the 2017 High Master’s Prize. In terms of personal goals, I first hope that it will serve as a light-hearted and accessible yet challenging subject matter with which I can practice and further develop my maths/physics abilities. I then hope that the research I do will help broaden my perspective in terms of the applications that problem-solving and different materials might have in the world, and give me a deeper insight into engineering. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Due to the nature of my project having to constantly reference digital formats such as film/video, animations and pictures, I felt that housing the project in a web format would be a more intuitive and convenient way to present my work. Over the course of the project I will write this website from scratch, which will help me hone another skillset as I go along. 
                    <br /><br />
                    I finally hope that beyond my own personal development goals, this website could serve as an educational resource for other students and the wider community – I hope that juxtaposing the trivial and the real world will provide an interesting link to science and engineering that people may not have had the opportunity to experience before. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Extra information: references are given at the bottom of each page and are done according to the Harvard Referencing System. 
                    <br /><br />
                    I hope you enjoy,
                    <br /><br />

For instance, how strong are his webs actually? How fast would he be able to swing? Start here to find out more.</h5>
