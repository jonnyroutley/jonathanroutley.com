    <h2>THE PHYSICS OF SPIDER-MAN</h2>
    
    <h4 class="section-text">
        Spider-Man first appeared over 55 years ago, in the fifteenth installment of the comic book <i>Amazing Fantasy</i>. 
        <!-- <img src="images/Amazing_Fantasy_15.jpg" id="amazing_spiderman" width="30%"> -->
        Since its inception in August 1962, Spider-Man has gone on to be one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes ever. Many attribute this to the fact that Spider-Man, or Peter Parker, was a new breed of superhero who was relatable in a way that the traditional comic book titans such as Batman and Superman weren't<sup>[1]</sup>. He's a not-so-cool teenager who gets picked on by bullies, isn't good with girls and has to face everyday struggles like the rest of us. It's only when Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider on a school trip to a lab that he develops powers: namely super strength, the ability to scale walls effortlessly and 'spider senses'. This section looks at some of the physics of Spider-Man, primarily using the 2012 film (starring Andrew Garfield) <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> as the main reference point. Although a new incarnation of Spider-Man has recently appeared in the Marvel film universe (with him getting his own film released earlier this Summer), I chose to use <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> as my main reference point due to it being the most recently made film available to purchase and watch at home/replay through it, thus making my research process easier. The different questions I look at are nested within a dropdown menu system below:

        <h3>How Strong are Spider-Man's Webs?</h3>
    </a>
    <div class="panel">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            While some adaptations of Spider-Man show the webs that the eponymous hero famously employs as an organic subtance that he produces within himself, most versions (this film included) portray the webs as an externally manufactured substance. In this particular film, the web has been originally created by the giant trans-national corporation 'Oscorp', packed into small canisters and then distributed accordingly. These canisters are then remodelled by Peter Parker to fit into a small wrist-watch sized device which can be triggered via touch sensors on his palms to shoot the web.
            One scene in this film shows Spider-Man catching a car that has been thrown off Williamsburg Bridge with his webs - using this scene, we can try and estimate the rough maximum strength of the webs. You can watch this scene below<sup>[a]</sup>:
        </h4>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1fmhSJa8ME?start=66&end=84" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4 class="section-text">
            The first things to determine are the mass and length of the car in question. Below is a snapshot of the film<sup>[b]</sup> which shows the car falling, and which was subsequently identified by the 'Internet Movie Cars Database (IMCDB)' as being a Mercedes-Benz S-Klasse Stretched Limousine<sup>[2]</sup>. As information about this car online was fairly limited, I opted to use specs from the most recent update of this car - the 2017 Mercedes-Maybach S600. This car is about 5.5m long and weighs around 2400kg<sup>[3]</sup>.
        </h4>
        <img src="images/merc.jpg" width="100%">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            Using this information, we can start to estimate the downwards momentum of the falling car. Before we can do this, however, we need a value for the velocity of the car before it is brought to a halt. We can use the constant acceleration (SUVAT) equations for this. At around 1:20 into the video above, we see that the car is suspended just above the waterline. As the distance from the water to the bridge is 41m<sup>[4]</sup> (assuming high tide) and the length of the car is 5.5m, I assigned the value of <i>s</i> (the distance the car falls) to be 35m. Assuming the car starts from rest, we can then say that:
        </h4>
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 1.jpg" width="50%" class="maths" id="maths_1">
        <h4 class="section-text"> 
            where <i>v</i> is the final velocity of the car, <i>u</i> is the initial velocity of the car and <i>a</i> is the acceleration of the car downwards due to gravity. Now that we have values for both the velocity and mass of the car, we can work out its momentum before it's stopped.
        </h4>
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 2.jpg" width="42%" class="maths" id="maths_2">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            As we know that it takes some time for the web to slow the car down, making the assumption that this stopping time is 1 second makes our calculations a bit easier (and is not unreasonable compared to the video above). The force (tension) that the web holds in bringing the car from its current state to at rest is the change in momentum divided by the change in time (1 second), or:
        </h4>
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 3.jpg" width="24%" class="maths" id="maths_3">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            We can then find the tension easily (approx value given but exact value used in later calculations):
        </h4>
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 4.jpg" width="35%" class="maths" id="maths_4">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            Although we're now close, we're not quite there. in order to find a good comparitive value for the strength of this web, we want to find the <i>Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)</i>. UTS is effectively a measure of how much a material can stand being stretched or pulled on before snapping<sup>[5]</sup>, and is useful in this instance for comparison as it's measured in N/m<sup>2</sup> - were it to not have this '/m<sup>2</sup>' feature, the obvious flaw would be that a thicker string or material would be able to bear a weightier load. In this instance, I'm going to guess that a typical web might have a radius of 2mm:
        </h4>
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 5.jpg" width="80%" class="maths" id="maths_5">
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 6.jpg" width="30%" class="maths" id="maths_6">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            We can finally therefore work out the UTS of the web given its equation. Note how it's converted from N/m<sup>2</sup>, or Pascals (Pa), to MegaPascals (MPa):
        </h4>
        <img src="images/maths/Maths 7.jpeg" width="45%" class="maths" id="maths_7">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            There we have it! His webs are around 5000MPa strong - roughly 5x the strength of average spider silk (1000MPa, although this value is a very rough average - spider silk strength values greatly range based on type of silk and species of spider)<sup>[6]</sup>. So how does this stand up to what we would expect? As we are dealing with fiction, the only thing we can do at this stage to judge whether our estimation is reasonable is to compare it to what the film says (which requires another big assumption that the film is scientifically accurate - famously rare amongst sci-fi/comic films). The film states (you can watch the clip on YouTube<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVHLpWsK-GI?start=41&end=52">here</a>) that this 'biocable' has a tensile strength 10x stronger than steel. A36 steel, one of the most common structural steels employed in the United States of America, has an ultimate tensile strength of around 400-550 MPa<sup>[7]</sup>. Somewhat surprisingly, this would mean that (assuming our calculations are correct) the film is pretty accurate with its description of the strength of this artifical web.
            <br /><br />
            In the next section we will look at what this means in a real world context and compare it to current man-made materials. For now, however, we will look at another aspect of Spider-Man.

        <h3>Is It Faster For Spider-Man To Run Or Swing?</h3>
    </a>
    <div class="panel">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            Aside from catching heavy object, Spider-Man also uses his trademark webs as a handy transport system to get around town or to make a quick getaway. Have a look at this scene here which shows Spider-Man making an escape from the police (who are not yet on his side)<sup>[c]</sup>
        </h4>

        <h4 class="section-text">
            The question that this then prompts is this: is it really faster for Spider-Man to swing? If we model his movement like that of a pendulum then we can make it a harmonic motion question. This would mean that the main thing affecting his swing speed is the length of the web he's swinging on - we can see from the video that the arches of the tunnel he attaches his webs to are not <i>that</i> high, and also he takes a non-direct/slower zig-zag route. Would it then potentially be faster for him to skateboard (his skills shown below)<sup>[d]</sup> or even run?

        <h3>How Does Spider-Man Stick To Walls?</h3>
    </a>
    <div class="panel">
        <h4 class="section-text"> 
            The final thing we will consider in this section is how Spider-Man sticks to walls. This aspect of his abilities (like many others) has seen several different interpretations in Hollywood. The 2002 film <i>Spider-Man</i> starring Tobey Maguire explains Spider-Man's ability to cling to walls via sticky, retractable hairs on his hands as so<sup>[f]</sup>:
        </h4>
        <img src="images/spiderman_hairs.jpg" width="100%">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            However, in the film we're referencing, it is seen as an innate ability that Peter Parker wakes up with having been bitten by the radio-active spider. How might we try and explain this? In order to try and find out I consulted the book <i>The Gecko’s Foot: How Scientists are Taking a Leaf from Nature's Book</i> by Peter Forbes<sup>[9]</sup>, which has become a major source for this project. In this book, he talks about the underlying mechanisms that enable geckos (and spiders among other insects/creatures) to seemingly effortlessly traipse unaided up walls and across ceilings. 
            He writes (p.82) with reference to the Tokay Gecko (<i>Gecko gecko</i>):
        </h4>
        <h4 class="quotation">
            "The electron microscope shows that there are very many bristles on the toes of a gecko: almost 500,000 on each foot. And more than that, the gecko has, as Autumn says, 'a bad case of split ends': the ends of the bristles fork into between 100 and 1,000 mini-bristles with enlarged and flattened spoon-like endings, spatulas, which, as Bob Full puts it, 'look like broccoli on the is of the hairs'. It is these spatulas that make contact with the surface and a single gecko has about one billion of these points of contact [below<sup>[g]</sup>]."
        </h4>
        <img src="images/gecko_foot.jpg" width = 90% id="gecko">
        <h4 class="section-text">
            The reason that this is so important is that by having bristles on the nano-scale, it means that the gecko can stick to any surface by means of <i>van der Waals</i> forces - not gravitational, electromagnetic or chemical but a force in its own category of intermolecular. The van der Waals force is a type of 'background attraction' that takes place between atoms or molecules and is only effective within a range of about 2nm. 
        </h4>
        <h4 class="section-text">
            The book also states (p.83-4):
        </h4>
        <h4 class="quotation">
            "Autumn's team showed that a single bristle did exhibit the force required to account for the adhesion of the foot: more than that, a single gecko bristle had 10 times more force than you would have expected given the force exerterd by the whole animal and the number of bristles. This suggested that at any one time only a fraction of the bristles was in contact. It also meant that if a gecko did have all its bristles in contact at the same time, it would be able to support a 120-kg man. In the real world it is unusual for two surfaces to touch at many points - surface may look to us as if they are in intimate contact but at the nanolevel hardly anything touches at all. To work effectively, the gecko has a huge margin of error. That is why it moves around so confidently and can suspend itself from a single toe: it knows it has plenty of adhesion in reserve."
        </h4>
        <h4 class="section-text">
            So how can we manipulate this knowledge and data in order to apply it to Spider-Man? Although we can probably assume that Spider-Man's mass is less than 120kg, we would want to figure out how many bristles he would need in order to have the same amount of headroom of adhesive power compared to the gecko.
            Combining the two quotations, we can first say that a typical gecko has 500,000 bristles on each foot, or 2,000,000 bristles in total. These 2,000,000 bristles, if all used would support up to 120kg, or about 1,180N (120 x 9.81 to 3sf). Therefore, each bristle would support 1,180/2,000,000N = 5.9x10<sup>-4</sup>N.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="section-text">
            The average (median) mass of a male Tokay Gecko is 0.234kg<sup>[10]</sup>, which means that it overcompensates the maximum amount of weight it would hold (assuming it just holds its bodyweight) by a factor of around 500 (120/0.234 = 513 (3sf). Assuming Spider-Man is roughly 75kg, this would mean he would be able to hold (as a theoretical maximum) a grand total of 37,500kg. This equates to 63,600,000 (3sf) bristles in total. Although this may sound like a lot, when you consider that an average (median) male gecko is about 30cm long and think of the comparative surface areas covered by the gecko's hands/feet compared to that of a (nearly) adult male, it seems to be more plausible - the density of bristles shouldn't be drastically different.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="section-text">
            One final thing that we might want to think about when considering this is how much control Spider-Man would have over his ability to stick to things. In the film, when he first discovers his powers, he involuntarily sticks to objects but slowly over time seems to gain more control over it - it finally appears that it is almost controlled at will. The solution, once again, would probably be to mimic the mechanism of the gecko once more - if his hand is peeled away at an angle from the surface, the bonds are broken extraordinarily easily. The only problem that remains is how he would stick to walls through his costume - the van der Waals forces have an incredibly short range as previously discussed. This problem is considered and developed in the next section (link below).
