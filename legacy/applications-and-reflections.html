    <h2>APPLICATIONS & REFLECTIONS</h2>
    <h4 class="section-text">
        This brings us to our final section! We've had a trivial glance at some of the physics and phenomena we see in the Spider-Man film universe and we've looked into further explaining how to make this fiction into a reality. This brings us to our final question - why? Why do we care at all about any of this?
        The first thing to draw attention back to is the initial name of the project - 'What Can Engineers Learn From Spider-Man?'. Being a personal project, the answer to the question of 'why?' is therefore a personal matter - people have long struggled to give a concrete definition to engineering but to me, in its simplest terms, it's about the utilisation of
        maths, science and design (amongst others) as tools in order to meet the needs of society. The crux of engineering (again, for me personally) is in helping people. So the answer to why I'm interested in this project is because if we can hold on to our childhood heroes, use our imagination and momentarily suspend disbelief, we may find that 
        there is serious potential hidden away in Spider-Man that could effect great positive change in our real world.
        <br />
        <br />
        So what sorts of ways could our findings help? What are the applications of these discoveries? 
    </h4>
    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <h4 class="section-text">
        We've mentioned a number of desirable characterisitcs about spider silk over the course of this project - they all mainly revolve around a a few key properties. They are: an impressive strength:weight ratio, superior elasticity, an ability to greatly absorb energy (think flies travelling at high velocity getting stopped by webs) and the sustainability and green factor.
        With those in mind, there's a plethora of varied uses for this silk, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Better cables for suspension bridges, towing cars etc.</li>
            <li>Lighter fabrics (for sail cloth, parachutes, hot air balloons)<sup>[1]</sup></li>
            <li>Airbags in cars for better absorption of energy/lower impact to the passenger<sup>[2]</sup></li>
            <li>Bike or skateboard helmets</li>
            <li>Body armour (like Kevlar)<sup>[2]</sup></li>
            <li>More delicate fabrics for high fashion and more eco-friendly fabrics for the wider market<sup>[3]</sup></li>
            <li>Use in hospitals* - wound dressings, ultra-fine stitches, knee replacements, nerve repairs<sup>[4]</sup></li>
            <li>Lightweight panelling for vehicles (aircraft, F1 cars)</li>
        </ul>
    </h4>
        <hr>
        <h5>*Spider silk is 'inherently biocompatible': people have used webs to treat wounds - stopping bleeding and preventing infection - since as early as the Ancient Greeks. As the wound heals, the web biodegrades. This has led to research into how it can be used in other medical/surgical implementations.</h5>
    <h4 class="section-text">
        Further to these uses, there are other things engineers can learn from Spider-Man. In the film referenced during this project, Uncle Ben (Spider-Man's uncle) rephrases the classic adage 'with great power, comes great responsibility' as: "your father lived by a philosophy, a principle, really. He believed that if you could do good things for other people, you had a moral obligation do those things. That's what's at stake here: not choice, responsibility." Potentially a tangent to the main nature of the project but an important point - engineering is about meeting the needs of society and therefore ideas of social responsibility and empathy are integral.

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <h4 class="section-text">
        Though I've had to change and adapt this project somewhat with respect to my initial introduction to it, I feel that I've accomplished all of the goals I've wanted to, whilst enjoying it along the way. I decided to not submit it for the High Master's Prize as the entry was much too long in terms of both content and the code attached - I didn't want to have to compromise the breadth or depth in which I wanted to give this project in order to make it submittable. In many ways this project was about more than just a competition entry - it was a way for me to engage more with engineering, independent study and self-improvement - 
        I feel I've particularly benefitted from having to be rigorous in my research (and consitent in my referencing) as well as having to adopt a different way of thinking when approaching problem solving. 
        <br /><br />
        In future updates to this project, I hope to mainly improve the website and its mobile/tablet compatibility. I think there's also much more scope for the applications section to be expanded and elaborated on.
        <br /><br />
        I hope you've found this project to be both informative and engaging, and I hope you've enjoyed reading it as much as I did writing it.
