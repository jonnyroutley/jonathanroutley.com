        <h4>In the last section we determined that the UTS (ultimate tensile strength) of Spider-Man's webs was about 5000Mpa - 5x the strength of 'average' spider silk and 10x as strong as structural steel. We (the real world), however, has never managed to properly reproduce regular spider silk artifically, let alone super strength silk. Spider silk has long been coveted due to its impressive properties - it has an extraordinary strength:weight ratio (6x that of steel), is highly recyclable/biodregradable (some spiders eat their webs and are able to recycle it with up to 90% efficiency). There has always been a problem in trying to produce it in viable quantities though - spiders are

            Another aspect of Spider-Man's webs that we might want to consider is how he stores them, how much he needs and subsequently how big a container is required to hold that much. As aforementioned in the last section, Peter Parker uses small canisters to store his bio-engineered webs before firing them. The scene in which he designs this web-firing device is here:

            The video states that a single one of these canisters (pictured below) can safely store 'several hundred metres of the lightweight cable'. Rather than try to deal with the semantics of 'several', I'm going to assign it the value of 5, i.e. 500 metres of cable. Using the same radius of web that we used previously (2mm) and

            We want to consider the 'packing efficiency' or <i>atomic packing factor (APF)</i> of these two designs - this will tell us which way of packing in the webs will utilise the available space best. Note also that for simplicity's sake I'm assuming that the web is able to fold back on itself in a perfect way so that it occupies no additional space. The APF is a dimensionless (without units) value and is given by the formula:

        <h4 class="section-text">
            Where <i>N<sub>particle</sub></i> is the number of particles in the area we're trying to work out, <i>V<sub>particle</sub></i> is the volume of the particles and <i>V<sub>unit cell</sub></i> is the volume of the container. In this instance, the particles are the circles, the unit cell is the canister and instead of volumes we're considering just areas as it's a 2-dimensional diagram. For each of the two designs, this gives us:

        <h4 class="section-text">
            Although the second design fits in one fewer circle, it is overall more efficient in the way it uses the space available. This is useful knowledge as we'll want to scale up the container and this design will help us yield better results over a larger area. This would also make for a marginally lighter design which would be more practical from Spider-Man's perspective.
